## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
   I implemented leaving comments in my code to help me organize the code easier so that other developers can know what's going on. I also worked on being more descriptive with my naming conventions.

2. What went well this week?
   While it was a difficult week, I finally admitted that I need some help and have started utilizing my resources more.

3. What would you do differently?
   I would have started asking for help and using my resources sooner.
