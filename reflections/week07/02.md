## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
   Code Documentation is essentially writing a guide for your code so that other people can understand how to use it. You can write howto guides, a README, or leave comments in the code itself.

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?
   If you use JSDoc documentation auto completion will improve and you'll get real time hints. For example, the editor will yell at you if you try to pass the wrong kind of parameters. Articulating what your code should do before actually writing the code can lead to better and simpler code because you understand what you are doing better. You will also choose better names for parameters, variables, and functions since you have put more thought into it beforehand.

3. How important is Code documentation and why?
   In larger projects where multiple people are using the code, it helps them understand how to use the code and what is going on, which leads to less confusion and more productivity.
