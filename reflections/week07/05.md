# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

-   What went well this week?
    I got caught up, kind of.
-   What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
    Nothing really shocked or surprised me this week. It was pretty straight forward, but stressful.
-   What are you struggling with?
    Lifecycle hooks.
-   What would you count as a victory?
    I think I got my project at least up to a MVP.
