## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
   Pair programming is when two programmers share one computer. One person drives and enters the information while the other programmer provides focus and direction. They swap roles on a regular basis.

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
   Speaking code out loud leads to clearer articulation of the complexities and hidden details in coding tasks. You have a second set of eyes to catch mistakes. The programmers share knowledge and can cover for the other in areas that they are weak in, and in turn that programmer learns and evolves.

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
   Some companies claim that pairing doubles the cost, however studies have shown that the increased productivity can offset that expense. Both of the programmers need to be actively engaged. If there are relationship issues and pair programming is forced upon the programmers, they may not be productive together.
