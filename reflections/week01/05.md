# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

-   What went well this week?
    I learned about some sites/tools that will be helpful through the course and my career.
-   What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
    We did a lot this week. I was not expecting to develop a whole mock site or multiple ones for that matter in the first week.
-   What are you struggling with?
    My learning style is diffferent than what is being taught. I tend to write things down and retain info better that way.
-   What would you count as a victory?
    I survived the first week!
