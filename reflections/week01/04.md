## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?
   A wireframe is used to plan out the design of a website.
2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
   Low-fidelity wireframes are the most basic wireframe. They are less accurate on things like scaling & pixel accuracy. They are a good starting point, are cheap, and a conversation starter when you start looking to build a website. The middle option is mid-fidelity wireframes, which has more detail than a low-fidelity wireframe. Mid-fidelity wireframes can display more features and prominence to specific elements like different headings or text. High-fidelity wireframes are mocks of a website that go into extensive detail. You can create additional wireframes for different screen sizes, go into pixel-specific detail, and may include the actual images the client wants. These are more commonly used in the later stages of a product design. A site used for high-fidelity wireframes is figma.
3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
   I believe wire-frames are worth the effort because projects tend to turn out better when they are planned. It sets an expectation between the developer and client, and can avoid designing a site that the client hates.
