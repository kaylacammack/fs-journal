## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?
   It allows developers to include separate JavaScript files in others instead of resorting to using multiple script tags.
2. How does export differ from export default?
   Export defaults are used to export a single module, variable, expression, or function from a JavaScript file so that it can be used in any other file of the same program or in an entirely different program. The export declaration is used to export values from a JavaScript module. Exported values can then be imported into other programs with the import declaration or dynamic import. The value of an imported binding is subject to change in the module that exports it.
3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?
   It makes debugging easier.
