## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
   To bundle and restrict access to data.
2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
   Internal objects tend to change more frequently than public objects. Some new developers are not familiar with the underscore prefix naming convention, so these changes can break the code for the users.
3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
   You can use closure or class fields. They don't rely on the conventional underscore prefix and enforce true encapsulation.
