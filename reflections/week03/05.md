# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

-   What went well this week?
    The flow made sense for the MVC file system.
-   What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
    The weekly journal reflections were a lot harder this week. I struggled to understand them and didn't really feel like they were covered in class.
-   What are you struggling with?
    Styling and overcoming writing block.
-   What would you count as a victory?
    Even though I don't really feel like I am where I want to be, I have come a long ways learning wise.
