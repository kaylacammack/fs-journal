## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
   An Enum is a strongly typed constant. They are used when a variable can only take one out of a set of possible values. This is useful when you want to limit a users response.

2. How can you modify an Enum?
   You can use the members of System.Enum.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
   Not in C#. I could use them in the ChoreScore project to list the day of the week to do a chore.
