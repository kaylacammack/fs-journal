## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
   a. Value Types - holds a value within its own memory space. The variables of this data type directly contain values.
   b. Reference Types - stores the address where the value is being stored, rather than storing the value directly.
   c. Pointer Types - a variable that holds the memory address of another type. Unlike reference types, pointer types are not tracked by the default garbage mechanism.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
   -boolean
   -byte
   -char
   -decimal
   -double
   -enum
   -float
   -int
   -long
   -sbyte
   -short
   -struct
   -uint
   -ulong
   -ushort
   A lot of them are similar, but c# is more detailed in how your data types are defined.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
   Reference types store where the value is located, almost like storing our home address in google maps as the coordinates of the address.
