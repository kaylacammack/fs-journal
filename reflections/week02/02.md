## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
   a. A Function Declaration, where you use the function keyword then the name of the function. The function definition is hoisted, allowing the function to be used before it is defined.
   b. A Function Expression, where you use an anonymous function (no name). They are not hoisted and cannot be used before they are defined.
   c. An Arrow Function is a shorthand way of writing a Function Expression.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
   Parameters are the names created in the function definition, whereas arguments are the values the function receives from each parameter

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
   Higher order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.
   Ex. without higher-order function:
   const persons = [
   { name: 'Peter', age: 16 },
   { name: 'Mark', age: 18 },
   { name: 'John', age: 27 },
   { name: 'Jane', age: 14 },
   { name: 'Tony', age 24 },
   ];

const fullAge = [];

for(let i = 0; i < persons.length; i++) {
if(persons[i].age >18) {
fullAge.push(persons[i]);
}
}

console.log (fullAge);

Ex. with higher-order function:
const persons = [
{ name: 'Peter', age: 16 },
{ name: 'Mark', age: 18 },
{ name: 'John', age: 27 },
{ name: 'Jane', age: 14 },
{ name: 'Tony', age: 24 },
];

const fullAge = persons.filter(person => person.age >=18);

console.log(fullAge);
