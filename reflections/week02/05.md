# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

-   What went well this week?
    I was able to stay caught up for the most part this week, so the weekend wasn't as stressful.
-   What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
    I was surprised to have some of the TA's teach. It was nice to be taught from a different perspective though.
-   What are you struggling with?
    While I feel like I am retaining a lot of the information I struggle with implementing it on my own. When guided I can recall the information and know what to do.
-   What would you count as a victory?
    I survived the week, and have learned a lot!
