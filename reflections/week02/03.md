## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
   You can either type information into the console on the dev tools or you can do it directly through your code.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
   The elements tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS. You can view each HTML element in detail, as well as any classes & ID's that have been applied and see what it will look like immediately without having to edit, save, and refresh your code. You can directly click on an element that you want to target.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
   Under the source tab of your code editor you can create break points which work like the debugger code that you could use in your console. It pauses your code on the line number of your code and you can step into the next line and watch what happens.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
I really enjoyed how Sam broke down planning the layout of a website, as this is something I have been struggling with. Planning can save headaches later on in your code.
