## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
   It helps you get organized and ultimately write cleaner, more-readable code.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
   Google, or take a break and come back with fresh eyes.
3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
   Coding is more than just writing code. It makes up about 10% of it. In my career I will be reading old code, and just because it has been used doesn't make it good. It will be my responsibility to improve upon it.
