## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
   Scope is where variables are available for use. They can be globally scoped when declared outside of a function or they can be function/locally scoped when defined within a function or block of code.
2. What is Hoisting ?
   Positioning is important as the code is read from top to bottom. If you try to initialize a variable before it is declared, you will get an error message, so by moving the variable and function declaration to the top it will work.
3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
   From my understanding, var is antiquated, and we should use let and not var. I would use const when I do not want to update or re-declare the value. I would use let when I want the value to be updated or re-declared at some point.
