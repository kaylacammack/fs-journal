## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
   A developer portfolio provides a way to show off your skills. It can be similar to a photographers portfolio where they use their work to show off their talent and give their clients an example of what to look forward to. Having a portfolio increases your visibility, and proves your proficiency in a subject.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
   Writing quality code makes a developer portfolio effective. You can have several small projects to show that you have flexibility, or a couple of larger projects to show your expertise.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
   I would include the checkpoint projects as I put more effort into those projects. I would probably want to revisit them and contribute more to the projects when I have the time.
