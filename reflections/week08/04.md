## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
   Unit testing - allows you to test individual units of code in isolation.
   Component testing - tests components in Vue. Typically they need to be mounted to the DOM in order to determine that they are working. There are libraries that provide a set of tools to test the component without relying in implementation.
   End-to-End (E2E) Testing - tests what actually happens when users use your application. Testing individual units or components can help to ensure that code is functional, but you don't really know how it will interact with the entire application.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
   I think they are all important, however I think that testing the smallest portion of code is the most useful because typically if it works it will likely work with the application.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
   I feel like component testing would be the least useful because it can have multiple units in the code, and I think testing smaller is better to identify what portion of the component needs to be fixed if there are bugs.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work
I appreciated the links to the libraries that provides testing tools. It is something that I may be able to implement with our capstone project.
