# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

-   What went well this week?
    I think I found a pretty good group to work with for my capstone. We communicate effectively and are flexible enough to let certain things go if a teammate has an idea of how they want something done.
-   What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
    It was stated that our teams project was not really challenging enough (i.e. can likely be built out into an afternoon), yet it had been approved which was a little frustrating.
-   What are you struggling with?
    Learning how to do things in Vue. I get that I previously did this work in prior weeks, but it is a little different in the full stack application and I'm struggling to do things in the Vue World.
-   What would you count as a victory?
    I was able to get my checkpoint to at least a passing grade.
