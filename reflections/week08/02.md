## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?
   In the article presented, it essentially states that you can minimize having multiple meetings that take away from the productivity of the team by keeping in communication throughout the day while also keeping the client informed of the team's progress.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
   Teams communicate throughout the day using slack as opposed to having client meetings and the 4 meetings included in Scrum methodology.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
   The unattainable triangle is a set of tradeoffs from the speed of development and price with the quality of the software delivered. The tradeoffs are if you want good service cheap it won't be done fast, if you want good service fast it won't be cheap, and if you want fast service cheap it won't be good.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work
I would like to add to the importance of communication on a small team that weren't brought up in today's article. Working on our capstones each member has different styles or ideas of how things should be done, so communicating what everybody wants/expects has become important to work well together. We agree on how we plan on doing something, who is going to be working on what, etc. We also have to agree on designated break times so that it doesn't feel like somebody is pulling all the weight and grows anomosity towards the other team members.
