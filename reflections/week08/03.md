## Questions

1. What is Software Development Testing?
   Software Development Testing is testing your code. According to the article for today's entry, it is best to test a single component to be sure that it is functional, instead of testing the whole system and trying to figure out what is broken.

2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?
   It is the first line of defense against bugs. It also gives you confidence in knowing that your code works. It displays professionalism by knowing your code works before sending it to a QA team to discover and have to send it back to you, which also makes testing increase efficiency and productivity.

3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?
   Code is constantly changing, and when the code changes, existing unit tests have to be updated as well or new ones have to be written. In addition, the cost of running the full software program is often just a few seconds of time vs with a car for example having to test the whole car, so developers can be reluctant to take the time to test.
