# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

-   What went well this week?
    I really enjoyed having Jake teach our final lecture. I learned a lot.
-   What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
    I was a little surprised with being discouraged for asking for help.
-   What are you struggling with?
    SQL
-   What would you count as a victory?
    Nobody even looked at my AllSpice.....I got stuck on it. It wasn't that I didn't put in the time and effort, but I definitely didn't get it to the point where I want it to be at.
