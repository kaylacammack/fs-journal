## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

My experience at BCW is a loaded question for me. Overall, I have grown professionally and learned a lot over the last 11 weeks and I am grateful, however, I have my concerns. My husband attended BCW 5 years ago, and based on his experience I came into the program with an expectation for the same quality of education that he received, which overall, I don't feel I completely received. Just as I am expected to show up prepared and on time to class each day, I expect my instructor to show up prepared and on time as well. It seemed that the daily projects were "winged" and not planned out with notes and class rarely got started earlier than 9:30 when we are expected to be present at 9. The naming conventions or lack thereof throughout the project made the handoffs confusing for references for me to turn to and does not help with what to expect in a professional job. While it was stated that they are meant to make sense to somebody that sat through lecture, it can be easy to forget why something was done a certain way, or the handoff may be viewed weeks or months down the road, and the memory of lecture makes it even more condoluded. I found a lot of the projects to be highly unprofessional. I understand that the learning experience should be fun, but I do expect a certain degree of professionalism, as ultimately I am aiming for a professional job.

This course has been difficult for me as I got strep throat 3 times, followed by 2 severe UTI's, and I take responsibility for missing more than the allowable time and some of the course work which resulted in me being placed on academic probation. When my instructor discussed the reprimands, he also brought up that he "didn't know to what extent my husband was helping me" and felt like it was hindering what he was trying to teach me. I strived to learn as much as I could from this course not only from my instructor, but from the TA's, documentation, and my husband did show me some different ways to do things, but I did all of my work on my own and I am proud of it. I aired my grievances in mid-December, and in hindsight I should have done it sooner, but I am the type of person who doesn't like to make trouble.

I met with Jake and Zach and I appreciate them taking the time to meet with me, and they had some valid points such as me not utilizing my resources such as asking the TA's for help when I needed it or requesting tutoring sessions. That is 100% on me. My instructor came over once after that meeting to ask if I needed help with anything. Aside from that one encounter, nothing changed after bringing up my concerns, and I felt like there was anomosity between my instructor and I after that meeting. I made a strong effort to ask for help. The majority of the time the TA's were very nice and helpful, but not able to answer my questions and referred me to Mick who gave me the cold shoulder. I even put in a tutor request, although I may not have done it properly. I ended up getting stuck and had to slack Jake to get some help with my auth0 so that I could complete my assignment.

When Jake taught class on Thursday 1/26/23 my mind was blown by the difference in the quality and professionalism of the education. There were a lot of topics covered that I got the impression we should have learned previously in the course. I learned more from that one day than I do in a few days with my regular instructor. The energy of the room went from "I'm just trying to get through this course" to being excited about learning all the cool things we can do. It proved to me that my gut feeling of getting a much lesser experience than my husband got with Jake as his instructor was correct. Knowing what I know now, I would not have taken this course if I had known that Jake was not going to be my instructor. I think my instructor has a lot of potential, but he needs to take the class seriously, and show up prepared. I also feel there was an attitude issue after I aired my grievances, and that could hinder his growth. Everybody should take constructive criticism seriously and learn from it.

Despite my concerns, I have learned many lessons, and will continue to learn as much as I can and grow both personally and professionally. During this final week I will dedicate the majority of my time to the project, but still take short breaks to avoid getting stuck and frustrated, and come back to code with fresh eyes. The TA's had some great tips when presenting the final, such as changing what I am working on to something I can easily knock out to get my confidence in myself back up, then come back to the harder stuff with a more positive mindset.

I have enjoyed the learning environment overall. The small class and staff makes the school feel more like family. I enjoy seeing my co-students and the staff learn and grow each day.
