## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
   Inheritance imprints identity into a class. It allows us to share or reuse code.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?
   You can declare a member as private or public. If it is private it is not visible from the child class, unless the child's class is nested in the parent class. Protected members are visible only in child classes. Internal members are visible in child classes located in the same assembly as the parent class.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?
   Child classes do not have access to private members, unless the child class is nested in the parent class.
