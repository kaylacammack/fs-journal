## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
   A primary key is unique data that is used to identify records on a table. Because it is unique, none of other records will have that same data record. An id is commonly used as a "primary key". A foreign key is similar to a primary key being that it is unique, but it is used to reference data from another table.

2. What is an `Alias`?
   An alias is like a shorthand version of a table name when writing a SQL statement.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctorsPatients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

SELECT * FROM doctorsPatients dp
INNER JOIN doctors d ON d.id = dp.doctorId
INNER JOIN patients p ON p.id = dp.patientId
