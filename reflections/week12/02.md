# Daily Reflection

Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?

## Prompts

-   How is today going?
    I have made more progress. I am focusing on client functionality first, then styling afterwards.
-   Are you managing your stress?
    I am continuing to practice self-care and taking periodic breaks from the code so that I can come back refreshed and with a set of fresh eyes.
-   What has you most worried?
    Being able to do the masonry layout, and imposter syndrome taking over.
