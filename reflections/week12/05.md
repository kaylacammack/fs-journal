# Final Reflection

The Final Week, The Final day of Course Work. How did it go? Are you ready for career week?

## Prompts

-   What went well this week?
    Overall I managed my time well. I stayed up all of last night working on getting my MVP done so I was ready to be graded this morning. I didn't want to cross the finish line at the last possible moment, and I wanted to have time to work on any issues that needed to be fixed to get it to passing if I ended up missing too many requirements. I was graded this morning and passed so I can breath and relax a little.
-   What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
    Nothing shocked or surprised me. It was a pretty straight forward week.
-   What are you struggling with?
    Styling.
-   What would you count as a victory?
    I passed the final checkpoint!
