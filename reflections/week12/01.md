# Daily Reflection

This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely?

## Prompts

-   How is today going?
    Today is going good. I got all of the postman tests in my project to pass and a couple of stretch postman tests completed.
-   Are you managing your stress?
    Yes. I am making sure I take the time for self-care and get enough rest.
-   What has you most worried?
    I feel a little rusty on front-end styling as the last few weeks have mostly been back-end.
