# Daily Reflection

Have you started the client? How is you vue application shaping up. Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page.

## Prompts

-   How is today going?
    I finished the backend over the weekend, so I am focusing on the client side's functionality. I have data rendering to the pages.
-   Are you managing your stress?
    I am continuing to practice self-care, and giving myself grace. I got stuck on some items, and reached out to the staff for help.
-   What has you most worried?
    Not passing after everything I have invested in the course. It hasn't been easy for not only me but for my family as well. When I get home from school my kids run up and hug me and tell me they miss me. I feel like if I fail that I would be letting my kids down.
