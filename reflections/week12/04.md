# Daily Reflection

One day left are you going to make it? We believe in you!ðŸ’–! Are you timeboxing appropriately?

## Prompts

-   How is today going?
    I received guidance from Jake and was graded in the afternoon even though I knew it wasn't up to passing yet. I learned a lot from the feedback provided, and received some much needed guidance on what I need to do to get my checkpoint to passing.
-   Are you managing your stress?
    Being on a time-crunch I have let my self-care slip a bit. Even when I try to take breaks I feel the urge to get back to work on the project, so I haven't really been stepping away from the code. I did take a some time to spend with my children though, which was very much needed for me and my children.
-   What has you most worried?
    I know at this point I will not meet the mock requirements and that's okay because I can still pass without that. I am worried that I will think I am passing other requirements, only to find out that I'm not when I am re-graded.
