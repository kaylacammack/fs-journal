## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?
   Async/await is used to avoid callback hell. Async/await specifically reduces the boilerplate code and makes the code easier to read and debug.

2. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?
   Use async in front of the function.

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?
   Using async/await reduces boilerplate code, makes code more clean to read, and makes debugging easier. It makes code look synchronous even though it's asynchronous without blocking the functionality behind the scenes.
