> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?
   The signs are several lines of code that is nested that creates a pyramid of closing parenthesis. The cause is when people try to write JavaScript in a way where execution happens visually from top to bottom. JavaScript jumps around.
2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
   Asynchronous code allows the program to run while a function that may take some time to load runs in the background and completes at a later time. This is a callback, saying to run that code when it's completed.
3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`
   a. Don't nest functions. Give your functions names(instead of being anonymous which makes handling errors more difficult), and use function hoisting.
   b. Handle every single error in every one of your callbacks.
   c. Create reusable functions and place them in a module.
