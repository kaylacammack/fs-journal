## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?
   Pending, resolved, and rejected.

   A promise seeks to resolve the issues of callback hell by chaining promises together by attaching them instead of passing them.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?
   Then is what we tell the promise to do if the request is resolved, and catch is what to do if the request is rejected.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Using catch on promises is great for debugging. It is helpful to have a pop-up for user interaction, and console log the error so that the error doesn't disappear on you before you have a chance to troubleshoot it.
