# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

-   What went well this week?
    The week was less stressful than the majority of the prior weeks. All of our team was present during the week. I think each of our team learned valuable lessons working on our project, and learning to work with each other.
-   What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
    Nothing really shocked or surprised me this week. Everything went according to plan.
-   What are you struggling with?
    I found it to be difficult pairing with certain individuals, especially when they didn't seem to want to work with me either. I felt like I was pulling teeth trying to open up communication. I feel like I have focused on trying to demonstrate my ability to work effectively with a team but have lost my voice in the process.
-   What would you count as a victory?
    I resisted the urge to work on my own and worked with my team.
