## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
   We have used multiple new api's for our technology. We have focused on using scrum with daily standups and agreements on pair programming and what tasks we should be working on. We initially wanted to incorporate google calendar in our app but we weren't able to figure out how to use their api.

2. What went well so far?
   Our group met 3 times over break. We have been doing a good job of communicating our thoughts and agreeing on how we should work on the project.

3. What would you do differently? Why?
   We have been told multiple times that our project is essentially inspire. I would have scrapped the idea from the getgo and done something different if it were my choice. My group didn't want to start from scratch on day 2 when we were told that our project was too similar to inspire.
