## Questions

1. What is a Github action and how do they work?
   A Github action is a text file that acts like a listener and executes an action when a change or condition has happened or been met.

2. What benefits do Github actions provide?
   Github actions can help automate continuous delivery and integration. You can run tests in multiple environments, which provides detailed logs that can be used to troubleshoot deploys in realtime while your actions are running.

3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?
   There are four different trigger actions that a workflow can use.
   a. Workflow - workflow is the main concept of GitHub actions. Workflow works by creating a series of YAML files that contain your actions that determine your workflow in your repositories. They respond to specific events, and executes jobs based on the event and actions listed in the file.
   b. Scheduled - listed in the YAML files, will execute actions based on a schedule
   c. Webhooks - a trigger that GitHub performs. Examples would be when somebody pushes, pulls, or forks your repository.
   d. External - known as a repository dispatch event, is an external process outside of GitHub. You would use this when you want something external to communicate back with your GitHub repository.
