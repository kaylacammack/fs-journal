## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?
   A Base64 Encoded Image is an image in binary format.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?
   With larger images the encoding will actually increase the file size over 25%, which not only uses more bandwidth, it also increases the download time. It increases the work to be done because the browser has to decode the Base64 encoded strings and then decode the images as well. In addition, you are not able to save the images to local storage or cache, so when you return to the website, you will have to fetch the images again when you go back to the site. Your images are not accessible through a public URL, which means that your users are unable to get links pointing back to your website which makes sharing content harder.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?
   In the past, web browsers had heavy limits on the number of concurrent connections they could send to the server. Because of this, image heavy websites would need to que requests and wait for the first requests to finish. Base64 used an already open HTTP connection to deliver images embedded directly into the HTML or CSS, which removed the need for the que. Nowadays, web browsers have become efficient in delivering hundreds of files through a single connection.
