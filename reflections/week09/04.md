## Questions

1. What is an SSL certificate?
   SSL certificates are small data files that cryptographically establish an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between the webs server and browser remain private.

2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?
   a. Extended Validation (EV SSL) certificates offers the highest level of security and is recommended for websites that need identity assurance, such as websites that collect payment information, or insurance companies. They are the most expensive to obtain. You must prove you are authorized to own the domain you are submitting, and it ensures that you are legally collecting the data needed to execute certain actions, such as a credit card number for an online transaction.
   b. Organization Validated (OV SSL) Certificate offers a medium level of encryption and verifies that your organization and domain validation are real. This option is used when you don't have the financial resources for an EV SSL but still want to offer a moderate level of encryption.
   c. Domain Validation (DV) Certificate offers a low level of encryption. This is the quickest validation you can receive. It will not vet any identity data, so you won't know who is receiving your encrypted information. This is used by businesses that want to have a EV SSL but do not have the financial resources to obtain one.
   d. Wildcard SSL Certificates - Cover your domain and subdomain number. If you buy a certificate for one domain, you can use the same certificate for subdomains. This option is cheaper than obtaining multiple SSL certificates for a number or domain.
   e. Unified Communications (UCC) SSL Certificate - aka Multi-domain SSL certificates, allows multiple domain names to be on the same certificate. They were created to bridge communication between a single server and browser but have since expanded to include multiple domain names by the same owner. Can cover up to 100 domain names.
   f. Single Domain SSL Certificate - A Single Domain SSL only protects one domain. You can't use it to protect subdomains or a completely different domain.

3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?
   It makes your site more trustworthy , especially if you are collecting personal information. It can increase your SEO because if your website is similar to another website but yours has an SSL certificate, your website may receive a rank boost because it's encrypted.
