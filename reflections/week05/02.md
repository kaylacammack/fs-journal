## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?
   One-To-One (1:1), One-To-Many (1:N), Many-To-Many (N:M)

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`
   The maximum document size is 16 MB. Linking will not grow the original document, making it less likely that the original document will not exceed the document size of 16 MB. It is also easier to return paginated data as teh application can slice and dice the data more easily.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
   One scenario is you could have a category with thousands of items in it, with many new items being added or removed.
