## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?
   Timeboxing is scheduling time to complete a task.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?
   A. Given the amount of tasks that I have, I will prioritize my tasks to ensure I get the most important ones done.
   B. At the end of each day I will define the 3 most important things that I need to complete the following today and have the mindset that I won't rest until those 3 things are completed.
   C. I will apply "strategic quitting." If I overestimate how long something will take and it is not one of the most important tasks, I will move on and create another timebox with more clear definitions of my goal such as "finalizing my project."
3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how?
   When I was working in property management I could have scheduled times for my tasks instead of going off of a never ending to do list, that never seemed to get completed. By planning more and having uninterrupted time to complete a task, I may have been more productive.
