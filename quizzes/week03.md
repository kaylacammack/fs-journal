**3.** What is Encapsulation?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
Encapsulation is the bundling of data and restricting access to the data in that bundle from outside.
```

**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
Single Responsibility Principle
```

**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
A class describes a data type, like a model. An instance of a class is an object of the data type that exists in memory. For example, a class is like the blueprint of a house, and an instance of a class is like the house that was built.
```

**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
A proxy object is like a copy of an original object that is used in place of the original object, but may behave like the original object operations like getting, setting, and defining properties.
```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
To separate business logic and display.
```

**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
The controller contains the logic that updates the model or view in response to input rom the users of the application. It's like a waitress at a diner. They take the order, and bring it back to the chefs (service) and they retrieve the order when it is ready.
```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
The service handles the business logic. For example, the chef will make an order when the waitress brings it to them, and charge the tab for the cost of the meal.
```

**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
The model holds the blueprint of what our objects are, and holds the template that the service accesses and manipulates.
```
